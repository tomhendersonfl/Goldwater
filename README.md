Water Tracker Project Overview

I. Background

The Goldwater Project (www.goldwaterproject.com) began about three years ago as an undertaking by the Texas Water Foundation and the consulting firm of Averitt & Associates. The project initially quantified and measured ongoing water conservation efforts within a 15-county area of Texas called Region H. Based on the success of the initial trial, the Texas State Legislature has issued a request for proposal for a state-wide rollout of the project, including an application to automate Averitt's current water tracking application, which is a collection of Excel spreadsheets.

II. Overview

The basic purpose of the application is to take in data from a variety of utility companies and government agencies, analyze the data to determine the effectiveness of various conservation efforts, and present the results to users in variety of graphical and tabular formats.

The application will be beta-tested in Texas Water Planning Region H before being rolled out state-wide. The ultimate goal is to license the application to water planners and utilities all across the country.

Currently, the application is planned for delivery in the following major phases:

Continue to accept input on spreadsheets and load the spreadsheets into database tables. Display results to users based on the spreadsheet data.
Input source data directly online and eliminate the spreadsheets. Perform all of the analysis and calculations that the spreadsheets were performing. Provide additional forms of user output.
Provide advanced simulations and "what-if" capabilities to predict the results of various conservation strategies.
